This is Clipboard Manager
Have you ever felt like copying multiple things was impossible in regular computers?
Every time you copy something, the previous thing you copied dissapears!
Clipboard Manager is here to help! Made by using Tkinter and pyperclip, Clipboard Manager keeps track of the things you copied so you can copy
to the fullest extent of your needs without feeling like you will lose what you have. 
For example: Lets say the statement, "Copying is hard, I wish there was a solution" was copied by a user of Clipboard Manager.
             Then the user decides to run the application. 
             The content copied will show up in the 1st row of the Clipboard Manager.
             After that, the user can copy, "Wow, now I have Clipboard Manager to help."
             That content will automatically show up in the second row of the Clipboard Manger.
             After that, if the user would like to paste the copied content somewhere, simply click on the row where the content is displayed.
             The content will automatically be added to the cursor, and the user can paste the content elsewhere.
BEWARE of copying secrets like username and passwords.
